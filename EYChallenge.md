Care Pledge interacts with Allo Protocol - an open-source protocol which is deployed on Ethereum. This code heavily utilizes [Allo Docs](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2) in its development. Since Allo Protocol is maintained on Ethereum, this code is written in Solidity (code: [Care Pledge Code](https://github.com/baileyspraggins/care-pledge)) in order to have this code deployed on the Ethereum network.

Public Network of Choice: Ethereum [Allo Contracts](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/overview/contracts)
